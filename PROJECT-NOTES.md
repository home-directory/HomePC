# Project Summary & Next Steps

## Goal
- Create a pseudo-interactive website where users navigate the site via the screen of a 3D computer model (not a game, but an immersive retro/IBM PC-like experience).

## Current Structure
- **3D Computer Model:** Rendered using Threlte in `Computer.svelte`, displayed in `+page.svelte`.
- **Modular Codebase:** Components and logic are organized under `src/lib/computer/` (e.g., `Renderer.svelte`, `GUI.svelte`, `scenes/`, `objects/`).
- **osCanvas.ts:** Used for managing a canvas texture for the computer screen.

## Planned UI/UX
- All navigation and content are shown on the 3D computer’s screen.
- User interacts with the “screen” (mouse/keyboard) to navigate the site, emulating an old IBM PC or DOS-like interface.

## UI Implementation Plan
- Use [`@threlte/flex`](https://threlte.xyz/docs/reference/flex/getting-started) for all “fake OS”/windowed UI on the computer screen.
  - Compose windows, panels, and layouts using `<Flex>` and `<Box>`.
  - Style UI to look retro (fonts, colors, window chrome).
  - Optionally, make windows draggable or resizable.
- Render the UI to a canvas and use it as a texture for the computer’s screen mesh in the 3D scene.

## Next Steps
1. Install `@threlte/flex`:
   ```bash
   npm install @threlte/flex
   ```
2. Build a “desktop” layout using `<Flex>` and `<Box>` for your fake OS.
3. Render this layout to the canvas that is mapped to your 3D computer’s screen.
4. Wire up user input (mouse/keyboard) to interact with the fake OS.
5. Continue modularizing: Each window/app can be a Svelte component.
